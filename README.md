# Code Along

A page where students (and teachers) code together, creating scripts with familiar blocks then transform the snippets to python to be run in python tutor (objective: notional machine), or studied in non-runtime environments like the parsonizer (objectives: logic & language structures) and spot & shuffle (objectives: key words & attention to textual detail).

Students or teachers can create & download review sheets as they go by saving helpful snippets and taking notes about what they learned including links to any helpful resources.
